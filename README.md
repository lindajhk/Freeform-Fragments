"Freeform Fragments" is a blog website where only the admin can create, edit, and delete blog posts but registered users can comment on blog posts via a RESTful API. Blog posts can be viewed by anyone, regardless or being a user. The application is built with Flask Python and utilizes SQLAlchemy for database management.
